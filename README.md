Let me know if you'd like me to help with any additional details or sections for the README!

**Suggestions:**
**a.** Would you like me to add an example `script.js` file with conversion logic for better understanding?  
**b.** Should I help you create a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository?
